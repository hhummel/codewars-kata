# codewars-kata
My personal solutions to training exercises from Codewars.com.  Kyu levels reflect difficulty, ranging from 8 kyu (novice) to 1 kyu (profficient).  Each solution has the title and a link to the statement of the kata.

An outstanding value of Codewars is seeing other people's solutions after having worked out a solution for myself.
